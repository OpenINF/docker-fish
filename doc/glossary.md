<details><summary>Host-specific System Configuration</summary><br />

_Purpose_

The `/etc/` hierarchy contains configuration files. A "configuration file" is a 
local file used to control the operation of a program; it must be static and
cannot be an executable binary.[^3.7]

<br />


<sup>To be clear, `/etc/` may contain executable scripts, such as the command
scripts commonly called by `init` to start and shut down the system and start
daemon processes. "Executable binary" in this context refers to direct machine
code or pseudocode not in a human-readable format, such as native ELF  
executables.</sup>

<br />

_Requirements_

No binaries may be located under `/etc/`.[^3.7]

The following directories, or symbolic links to directories are required in
`/etc/`:

<br />

| Directory | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |  
| `opt`     | Configuration for `/opt/` |

<br />

_Specific Options_

The following directories, or symbolic links to directories must be in `/etc/`,
if the corresponding subsystem is installed:

<br />

| Directory   | Description                                      |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `X11`       | Configuration for the X Window system (optional) |
| `sgml`      | Configuration for SGML (optional)                |
| `xml`       | Configuration for XML (optional)                 |

<br />

<sup>Systems that use the shadow password suite will have additional 
configuration files in `/etc/` (`/etc/shadow/` and others) and programs in
`/usr/sbin/` (**`useradd`**, **`usermod`**, and others).</sup>

<br />

#### access control list (ACL)

</dt>
<div align="right"><note place="source"><ref target="chap15">

[⑮📑][]

</ref></note></div>
<dd>

A detailed method of assigning granular user and group permissions to files and
directories in a Linux system distinct from and more advanced than that which is
governed by the [`chmod`][] command; involves setting an [access control list
(ACL)][] for each file and directory.

ACLs allow **system administrators** to define not just read, write, and execute
permissions for multiple users or groups but also more advanced rules like set
user ID on execution, set group ID on execution, and
[inherited permissions](#inheritance).

On the flip side, ACLs allow **file owners** to specify extended access information
about a file, granting additional rights to users/groups other than those owning
the file. This form of _discretionary access control_ allows users to manage
their own collaborative projects without intervention of **system administrators**
to maintain groups, but also without granting rights to all users on the system
via use of the "other" permission bits.[^17.7]

The [`setfacl`][] command allows one
to set these permissions, and the [`getfacl`][] command allows one to view these
permissions as they exist in real-time.

For example, an ACL could allow user Bob read/write access to `file1.txt` while
denying access to `file2.txt`, allow the `sysadmin` group full access to a set
of configuration files, and set the `setuid` bit on a program while removing
access for other users.

ACLs are implemented as extended attributes in the [Linux ext file systems][]
and store the security rules in the metadata of the file or directory being
protected rather than altering the standard Unix permission bits. This allows
them to augment and extend the standard [Unix file permissions][] model and are
critical for implementing least privilege and defense in depth when securing
sensitive Linux resources.

The next level of security involves setting context-based permissions à la
[SELinux][] (for Red Hat–based Linux distributions) and [AppArmor][] (for
Debian-based Linux distributions).

A command-line command that allows a way to perform commands as another user. It
aims to be a a simplified and lightweight replacement for [`sudo`][]. [`doas`][]
is easy to configure and use and suits most use cases.[^15.4] The [`doas`][]
tool was originally developed for OpenBSD as a simpler and safer [`sudo`][]
replacement and was released with OpenBSD 5.8 in October 2015 replacing
[`sudo`][].[^15.1][^15.2]

For a smooth transition from [`sudo`][] to [`doas`][] and to stay downward
compatible, one may add the following to one's own shell environment.[^15.3]

```fish
alias sudo='doas'
alias sudoedit='doas rnano'

#### Docker image

An _image_ is a read-only template with instructions for creating a
Docker container. Often, an image is _based on_ another image, with some
additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is
based on the `ubuntu` image, but installs the Apache web server and your
application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your
application run.[^2]

</dd><br /><br />
<dt id="docker-image-layer">

#### Docker image layer

</dt><br />
<dd>

The order of Dockerfile instructions matter. A Docker build consists of
a series of ordered build instructions. Each instruction in a Dockerfile
roughly translates to an _image layer_. The following diagram illustrates
how a Dockerfile translates into a stack of layers in a container image.[^3]
<br /><br />

<div align="center">

    src="https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/images/layers.png"
  /><br />
  <figcaption>From Dockerfile to layers</figcaption>
</figure>
</div><br /><br />

Docker images have _intermediate layers_ that increase reusability,
decrease disk usage, and speed up docker build by allowing each step to
be cached. These intermediate layers are not shown by default.[^4]

Each `RUN` instruction will create a new layer in the resulting image.
Therefore squashing consecutive `RUN` instructions will reduce the layer
count (see https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/). In
addition to that, each `RUN` instruction runs in its own shell, which
can be the source of confusion when part of a `RUN` instruction changes
something about the environment, because these changes may vanish in the
next `RUN` instruction.[^4.1]

The [`mount`][] command allows users to **_mount_**, i.e., attach additional
child filesystems to a particular mount point on the currently accessible
filesystem.

<details>
<summary>Learn more&hellip;</summary>


To temporarily mount a filesystem to the Linux virtual directory, use the
[`mount`][] command; the basic format for the [`mount`][] command is:

```console
$ mount -t fstype device mountpoint
```

Use the `-t` command-line option to specify the filesystem type of the device:

```console
$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /media/usb1
```

If one specifies the [`mount`][] command with no parameters, it displays all
devices currently mounted on the Linux system. Be prepared for a long output
though, as most Linux distributions mount many virtual devices in the virtual
directory to provide information about system resources. [Listing 11.1][] shows a
partial output from a [`mount`][] command.

<div align="center"><br /><br />
<figure id="listing_11-1"><div align="left">

```console
$ mount
...
/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/sda1 on /boot/efi type vfat
 (rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859
-1,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)
...
/dev/sdb1 on /media/usb1 type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
/dev/sdb2 on /media/usb2 type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
rich@rich-TestBox2:~$
```

</div><br /><figcaption>

***Listing 11.1 | Output from the [`mount`][] command.***

</figcaption>
</figure><br /><br />
</div>

To save space, the output from the [`mount`][] command was trimmed down to _only_ show
the physical devices on the system. The main hard drive device (`/dev/sda`)
contains two partitions, and the USB memory stick device (`/dev/sdb`) also
contains two partitions.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenINF/GitHub-Markdown/HEAD/blockquotes/badge/light-theme/info.svg">
  <img alt="Note" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenINF/GitHub-Markdown/HEAD/blockquotes/badge/dark-theme/info.svg">
</picture><br />

The [`mount`][] command uses the `-o` option to specify additional features of the
filesystem, such as mounting it in read-only mode, user permissions assigned to
the mount point, and how data is stored on the device. These options are shown
in the output of the [`mount`][] command. Usually, one may omit the `-o` option to
use the system defaults for the new mountpoint.

The downside to the [`mount`][] command is that it only **temporarily** mounts the
device in the virtual directory. On rebooting the system, one must still
manually mount the devices again. This is usually fine for removable devices,
such as USB memory sticks, but for more permanent devices, it would be nice if
Linux automatically mounted them for us &mdash; fortunately for us &mdash; Linux can do
just that.

To remove a mounted drive from the virtual directory, use the [`umount`][] command
(note the missing _&ldquo;n&rdquo;_). One may remove the mounted drive by specifying either
i) the device filename or ii) the mountpoint directory.

The project claims the _r_ stands for _rocket fast_. Speed is
the focus of the rsyslog project and the rsyslog application had quickly
become the standard logging package for many Linux distributions.

It offers high performance, great security features, and a modular design. While
it started as a regular [syslogd][], [rsyslog][] has evolved into a kind of
Swiss army knife of logging, being able to:

- accept inputs from a wide variety of sources
- transform them
- output the results to diverse destinations

Rsyslog has a strong enterprise focus but also scales down to small systems. It
supports, among others, MySQL, PostgreSQL, failover log destinations,
ElasticSearch, syslog/tcp transport, fine grain output format control, high
precision timestamps, queued operations, and the ability to filter on any
message part.[^8]

</dd><br />
<dt id="syslog">
  
#### Syslog

</dt><br />
<dd>

A de facto Unix and Linux protocol for storing event messages.

The syslog protocol has become the de facto standard for most Linux logging
applications. It identifies events using a [facility](#facility) code, which
defines the event type, and a [severity](#severity), which defines how important
the event message is. The [`sysklogd`][], [`syslogd-ng`][], and [`rsyslogd`][]
applications all use the syslog protocol for managing system and application
events in Linux.

</dd><br />

<anchor 𝚡𝚖𝚕:id="klogd" id="klogd" />
<dt id="sysklogd">
  
#### `sysklogd`

</dt><br />
<dd>

The original [Syslog][] application; includes two programs:

1. [`syslogd`][]: to monitor the system and applications for events
2. [`klogd`][]: to monitor the Linux kernel for events

</dd><br />
<dt id="syslogd-ng">
  
#### `syslogd-ng`

</dt><br />
<dd>

An application that is used to manage log messages and implement centralized
logging where the aim is to collect log messages of several devices on a single
and central log server. This program added advanced features, such as message
filtering and the ability to send messages to remote hosts.

`syslog-ng` is available on a number of different Linux and Unix distributions.
Some install it as the system default, or provide it as a package that replaces
the previous standard syslogd. Several Linux distributions that used `syslog-ng`
have replaced it with [`rsyslog`][].[^7]

</dd><br />
<dt id="systemd">

#### Systemd

</dt>
<dd>

A system and session manager for Linux, compatible with System V and
LSB init scripts.[^10] The main features are:

- provides aggressive parallelization capabilities
- uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services
- offers on-demand starting of daemons
- keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups
- supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state
- maintains mount and automount points
- implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic

</dd><br />
<dt id="systemd-journald">

#### `systemd-journald`

</dt>
<dd>

This is part of the [Systemd][] application for system startup and initialization.
Many Linux distributions are now using this for logging. It does not follow the
[syslog][] protocol, but uses a completely different way of reporting and storing
system and application events.
