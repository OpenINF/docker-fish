### Acknowledgments

This project was originally inspired by the [`docker-fish`][] project, which
started out in 2020 (by [@andreiborisov][]) with the aim of building a
somewhat-official Docker container for the [fish shell][]; however, that was
solely for the Alpine distribution of Linux. Notably, that project was
originally hosted on Andrei's personal GitHub account, but was later moved
elsewhere some time _after_ we had re-imagined/revived it with community
support. We are, however, not affiliated with the new organization it is home to
nor are we involved in its day-to-day development and do not wish to impy that
we make any endoresement; hence, the reason for this re-construction.

It was introduced to [@DerekNonGeneric][] by [@jorgebucaran][]: Thank you so
much to [@jorgebucaran][] for the introduction as it is now able to serve as the
inspiration/basis for this project. Thank you to all our contributors! <3
