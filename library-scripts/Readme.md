## Maintenance Note

These scripts' provenance can be traced back to the [vscode-dev-containers][]
repository's [script-library folder][]. However, in some cases, they may have
undergone significant modifications by the OpenINF community and may no longer
be recognizable. The VS Code and Codespaces teams no longer support these old
scripts in lieu of ["features"-based approach][devcontainers-features].

Our community strongly supports the [fish shell][] and its ecosystem, including
[Fisher][]. Therefore, we have adapted these scripts to work with [fish shell][]
instead of Z shell (Zsh) and Bash. As we continually engage in script library
enrichment, these less-efficient shells will be refined away entirely.

As the OpenINF community has significantly improved these scripts and the VS
Code and Codespaces teams no longer support them, we maintain this script
library separately. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the
scripts, please [open an issue][] on the GitHub repository for _this_ project.
