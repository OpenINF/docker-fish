## Vision

The actually intended use cases are geared toward academia and supporting all of
our shared research directions (likewise strongly in support of and supported by
the broader Fisher plugin community).

As we're constructing education-flavored images, our aim is reaching desirable
compatibility for educational purposes and can only hope that broader academic
circles would be interested in sharing their findings with us as it may assist
us guide future developments.
